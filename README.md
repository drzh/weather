This package contains the implementation of ConvLSTM modules to predict the cloud coverage in next few hours. The model is based on the model of [MetNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12140)

'convlstm.py' module is from [ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch)

'axial-attention' module is from [lucidrains/axial-attention ](https://github.com/lucidrains/axial-attention)
