# Predicting Cloud Coverage Using ConvLSTM Model
## Introduction
This package contains the implementation of modules to predict the cloud coverage using ConvLSTM and Aixal-Attention models. The forcast model is based on [MetNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12140)

## External modules
'convlstm.py' module is from [ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch)  
'axial-attention' module is from [lucidrains/axial-attention ](https://github.com/lucidrains/axial-attention)
